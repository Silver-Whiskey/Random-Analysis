This is a learners attempt to analyse the playing trends of some football clubs over 12 seasons / year.
=> More, analysis will be added soon.
1.) I compared two categorical variables, namely total scoring attempts and on-target scoring attempts. 
    - I found these variables to be highly correlated.
    - More the number of attempts, the more went on target.
